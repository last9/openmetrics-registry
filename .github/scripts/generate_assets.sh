# This script's responsibility is to create a list of modules to be uploaded as
# release assets. To achieve that, it takes the following steps:
#
#   1. Get a list of HCL files to release
#     A. If this is a module release, then only take the list of modules that
#     have changed since he last release
#     B. If this is a major release, then take all the modules (the first
#     agruement is passed as "major")
#
#   2. Once we have that list, we need to create a mapping of those file paths
#   to the names that they will be released as
#   Format: <release asset name>:<file path>
#   Example: aws_cloudwatch_rds_v0.0.1.hcl:aws/cloudwatch/rds/rds.hcl
#
#   3. This mapping will be fed to the github action that will upload the
#   assets with the specified names
